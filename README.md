## Simple snake game developed using vanilla JS and HTML5 canvas element.
Todo:
- It somehow works not that bad, but code is not good enough (not good at all), so redesign it and redo.
- Easy snake step changing with one parameter.
- Dashboard with high scores and player names.
- Multiplayer? +Some interesting features?
